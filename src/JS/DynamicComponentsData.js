      "My career began as an Equity Research analyst on Wall St. I started the MBA program at NYU in the Fall of 2008, right as the market crashed, with Occupy Wall St. protests happening outside our campus doors. As often happens, times of crises create opportunity and I shifted my career focus from finance to marketing & entrepreneurship. I began my entrepreneurial journey with ups and downs and great learning - most importantly, discovering my passion and purpose in supporting women in elevating their voices and professional and personal success. I have led and participated in women-related communities in investing, startups, technology, AI, futurism, product and data science. I have placed over 350 women in speaking opportunities and experience shared value and fulfillment when I see women stepping into their full potential. I bring the value of ten years in finance, and ten years of community architecting & growth marketing, to  Si Her as it`s platform creator. And my exploration in Equity Research continues.",

It's not just about where I come from; it's a profound connection that shapes my values and perspectives.<br>As a poet, words are not just tools; they're my secret language with the world. Poetry isn't merely something I do; it's an inherent part of who I am. It's the lens through which I explore emotions, connecting with others on a heart level. I craft worlds that resonate emotionally, revealing the narratives that often go unnoticed.<br> I'm a Multipotentialite, a curious cat diving into various realms of life. A specialist in intersectionality, I connect seemingly disparate dots, celebrating the beauty of diversity in experiences.<br> That's why, in web3, I'm more than a content creator. I am a writer, poet, and narrative alchemist; an advocate for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Accessibility (DEIBA) — a fusion of creativity, cultural roots, and a relentless commitment to weaving authentic & human narratives in the evolving digital landscape.",

      "As the first family member to attend university, I always worked while studying. I've been mixing cocktails since the age of 18 (and I still do now and then out of passion!) to pay for the various degrees in law and political science I've earned. I've worked as a bartender in both Italy and the Netherlands and later ventured into entrepreneurship in the same sector. I believe that hard work can be learned anywhere.Trained to enter what I now refer to as 'legacy institutions,' I initially pursued a career in academia. However, as I studied the crucial role of technology in societal development and analysed the decline of many of today's legal, political, and economic institutions, I was drawn to the transparency, free spirit, and merit-based nature of Web3. I have been loosely involved with crypto since 2017. I joined Web3 to contribute to real change. Over time, I've found that despite Web3's focus on transparency and trustlessness, business in this space is still subject to barriers. Why? Because it's conducted by humans. And no one is perfect. Consequently, Web3 as an industry still presents many opportunity costs and access barriers. Networks, locations, and financial resources are still key. I believe we can't afford to waste time or opportunities. Instead, I believe that Web3's sustainable success lies in connecting with the right people and simply build. Together.",
